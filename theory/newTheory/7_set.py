Set is an unordered collection of unique items.
Set is defined by values separated by comma inside braces { }.
Items in a set are not ordered

"""
We can perform set operations like union, intersection on two sets.
 Sets have unique values. They eliminate duplicates.

a = {1,2,2,3,3,3}

"""
Since, set are unordered collection, indexing has no meaning.
 Hence, the slicing operator [] does not work.
