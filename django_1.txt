Django is a free and open source web application framework written in python.

1.) django helps in splitting of a website into different apps using the urls.py page.
  eg: a website has a home page app, a admin page app, a about page app, etc.

2.) APP Vs PROJECT
   What’s the difference between a project and an app? An app is a web application that does something –
   e.g., a blog system, a database of public records or a small poll app. A project is a collection of configuration 
   and apps for a particular website.
   A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects
   
3.) In settings.py file installed apps are mentioned.
   Also, note the INSTALLED_APPS setting at the top of the file. That holds the names of all Django applications that are
   activated in this Django instance.Apps can be used in multiple projects, and you can package and distribute them for
   use by others in their projects.
   
    These applications are included by default as a convenience for the common case.

    of these applications make use of at least one database table, though, so we need 
	to create the tables in the database before we can use them. To do that, run the following command:
           $ python manage.py migrate
		   
    The migrate command looks at the INSTALLED_APPS setting and creates any necessary database tables according 
	to the database settings in your mysite/settings.py file and the database migrations shipped with the app.
